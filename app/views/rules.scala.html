                • This game can be played with 1-4 Players.<br>
                • Each player has four pieces to move, and they all start at their home field.<br>
                • A piece can be moved on their own starting point if a player rolls a six.<br>
                • If all pieces are still in their home field, a player is allowed to roll the dice three times.<br>
                • If a six is rolled, the player is allowed to roll the dice again.<br>
                • When a piece is already on the  starting point and a six is rolled, the player first has to move the piece that is on the starting point.<br>
                • The goal is to get all the four pieces into their finish fields.<br>
                • Pieces can jump over other pieces and throw out pieces from other players if they land on their field.<br>
                • A Player cannot throw out his own pieces and cannot advance further than the last field in the home row.
